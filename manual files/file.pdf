        "note": "1. God did not give to his children the spirit of complain\n2. God did not give to his children anointing to complain\n3. God did not give to his children the grace to complain\n\nWhat God gave to His children is the grace and anointing to overcome and come out plain with testimony – 2Corin.12:7-9\n\n4. When a child of God is full of complain, he removes himself from the atmosphere and the presence of God to the atmosphere and presence of Satan the devil\n5. When a child of God is full of complain, he transfers himself from the grace and the will of God to the region and atmosphere of devil and evil spirit. Num.11:1-2",
        "note": "When the enemy gives you a dream about your life, or what is about to happen to you soon, when you wake up from the dream, you need to prayerfully reject and remove it from the way.\nDevil cannot do anything in your life except he first get your approval and your signature, if the devil send a dream of poverty to you that you are poor e.t.c. and you wake-up from the dream without prayerfully rejecting that dream that means you have approved the plan of the devil to carry on his plan. By that action of not opposing the enemies plan the devil has just succeeded in making the person to sign his signature on that dream Dream is a reporter that reports to you the evil plan of the enemies and the good plan of God. God has given us weapons of warfare to evacuate Satan’s negative dreams, plans, thoughts and imaginations.",
